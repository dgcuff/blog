I haven't been posting. Why? Because I ran into a technical issue that prevented me from connecting to GitHub. Weekend after weekend, I tried to solve it. 

I read post after post that claimed to have the fix. None of them helped. I have decent beginner's technical skills, but I could not find a fix.

Eventually, I accepted that I was going to have to uninstall (part of) a commercial piece of software. It still took a couple of weeks that get that completely erased from my system.

But when I had, other things got broken. It seems that the commercial software didn't bother to remove itself in a safe manner. Very much the equivalent of taking the baseball and going home.

Plus, in the past year, I've moved from one computer to another, and that messed up a few things as well.

So I've switched to a brand new platform (from Jekyll to Hugo).

I'm back. I've had two blog posts outlined for over a year. I expect to have to restructure them, but I will start posting again.
