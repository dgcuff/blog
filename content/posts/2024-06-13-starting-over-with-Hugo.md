As I mentioned in [Why no blog updates for over a year](../2024-03-02-absence/), I ran into some problems with Jekyll, the framework I used to publish blog entries. I eventually fixed the problem. Then I tried to update Jekyll. Which caused different problems.

So I'm done with Jekyll. I've moved to Hugo. While that _is_ the name of Martin Scorscese's only film for children, it's also the name of another framework for building websites.

Frankly, both Jekyll and Hugo are probably more than I need to write a few blog posts. Initially I wanted the challenge of setting up a framework that would allow me to write my blog posts in Markdown and not have to think too much about publishing. But once I had successfully completed the challenge, I found I didn't need the headaches of keeping the framework working.
