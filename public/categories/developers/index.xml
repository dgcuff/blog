      <description>I spend most of my time at work thinking about the product users. Those are the people who will be reading what I wrote. That means I spend a lot of time considering what each person might not know, and might not know they don&amp;rsquo;t know. Part of the job of a technical writer is helping people learn. Which puts me in a very different head space than a lot of the people I work with.</description>

      <description>During the course of a career lasting over 20 years, would you care to guess how many times I have been given data from a software developer that later turned out not to be correct?&#xA;A maximum of three.&#xA;Once, another developer informed me that something I had written wasn&amp;rsquo;t true. I provided the developer with a copy of the e-mail in which a different developer had said it was true.</description>

      <description>Writing requires that you try to reach your reader. Technical writing doubly so. And that&amp;rsquo;s the part that isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. There are obstacles, and you have to do the work of overcoming all of them all of the time.&#xA;Here are five of my rules for technical writers.&#xA;You have to understand your topic.&#xA;In a lot of life, in conversations and in writing, you can have a vague idea of how something works.</description>

      <description>Development can be incredibly self-focussed. Development managers and developers share information with members of the development team, and can be positively stunned to learn that not everyone has access.&#xA;Nowhere is this more obvious than when development is complete.&#xA;There is a belief that the deadline is available to technical writers, and in my experience, it is not available more than 50% of the time. There is a stronger belief that the availability of a feature to product users is known to everyone once development is complete.</description>
