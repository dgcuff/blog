			<p>Development can be incredibly self-focussed. Development managers and developers share information with members of the development team, and can be positively stunned to learn that not everyone has access.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more obvious than when development is complete.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a belief that the deadline is available to technical writers, and in my experience, it is not available more than 50% of the time.</li>
<li>There is a stronger belief that the availability of a feature to product users is known to <em>everyone</em> once development is complete. That has enormous impact on technical writers because:
<ul>
<li>Technical writers sometimes must wait for confirmation that the product&rsquo;s functionality is available before taking the step that makes documentation visible to customers.</li>
<li>Technical writers sometimes do not have access to the product that users do, and cannot check whether the functionality has been made available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I sympathize with you if you want to believe, &ldquo;Well, those are just companies that communicate poorly.&rdquo; That may be so. But they are still the vast majority of companies, and I lose sympathy with you if you want to argue that they are a minority.</p>
<p>As anyone who has ever experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile software development</a> will tell you, communication that focusses on development-client or development-development has a strong tendency to exclude everyone not part of those groups. And if the company&rsquo;s values do not consider that testing and user documentation are part of development, that definitely seeps down into developers and those people who manage the developers.</p>
<p>As someone who prefers the title &ldquo;technical writer,&rdquo; I am still willing to champion the term &ldquo;information developer&rdquo; for anyone in my role who must work in an Agile development environment. It can make the difference between exclusion from and inclusion in Agile meetings.</p>
<p>In my time, I have ensured that if developers did not keep me informed, then I did the work of asking for the latest information. I recommend that all technical writers be pro-active in keeping communication open. Communication defines our jobs, after all.</p>
<p>But I have enormous sympathy for any technical writer who reports that being pro-active keeps being pushed aside in order to deal with the constant stream of new tasks. If you&rsquo;ve ever worked in food service, you&rsquo;ll understand the long-term effects on your psyche of there always being someone new with new demands in the queue. The queue is eternal. Closure is a myth.</p>
