			<p>Did you know that there was a time when people actually read release notes? Not all people read them, but some regular customers did.</p>
<p>Since I became an iPhone user, I&rsquo;ve started noticing the release notes for updated versions of iPhone apps. The only major software publisher that consistly explains what&rsquo;s new in a release is&hellip; Apple itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Streamlined in-app notifications inform you when a person joins a collaborative document for the first time</li>
<li>Preseve file format and full quality when adding HEIC photos taken on iPhone or iPad</li>
<li>On iPad, press and hold the Command key on a connected keyboard to select noncontigous words, sentences, or paragraphs using a trackpad or mouse</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not new that the release notes are an afterthought. Too often, they are written by the developer who has been given the responsibility for actually submitting the software for distribution.</p>
<p>I find it hard to blame developers for not writing a release note for an iPhone app. We&rsquo;ve been told over and over again that you must download the most recent version of an app. It doesn&rsquo;t matter why it was changed; update this app! Update all the apps! All the time! In fact, turn on automatic updates so that apps get updated automatically!</p>
<p>If you own an iPhone, go to the App Store, select any app, and (if necessary) scroll to the section heading &ldquo;What&rsquo;s New,&rdquo; you will also see a link to Version History. Which is invariably the same release note over and over.</p>
<p>The best you can hope for that is the company will write a message for a major release&hellip; which you will see repeated for every update until the next major release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New &lsquo;Save as Draft&rsquo; feature. You can now save your unfinished post to revisit later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now learn Math and Music on Duolingo!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most frequent text here is the standard, unhelpful message from development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bug fixes and performance improvements</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even those beat the unhelpful messages from marketing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do more with PayPal, with more power packed into a single app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or a trend I thought we had euthanized over 30 years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for using Google Maps!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact is, technical writers rarely get to write release notes any more. It&rsquo;s become the domain of the marketing department. (<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-art-of-writing-app-release-notes">The Transit app had an in-house copywriter, Joe MacNeil.</a>)</p>
<p>Whether copywriter or software developer, people who have nothing to say can choose to say nothing amusingly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve added some stability and performance improvements, taken out the trash, mown the lawn, and now we need a little nap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, this software publisher has taken to changing the ending:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;took the afternoon off.</p>
<p>&hellip;explored the edges of the known universe.</p>
<p>&hellip;drank way too much coffee.</p>
<p>&hellip;and more cat videos.</p>
<p>&hellip;repairs to the space-time continuum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last point brings me all the way back to the 1970s, when microcomputers became a thing, and technical writers had to write for the general public for very nearly the first time. (Up until that point, technical writers wrote for engineers.) I still remember an early Apple manual about its Disk Operating System where the writer was clearly making jokes to keep himself amused.</p>
<p>Long before I became a technical writer or even knew that was a thing, I remember reacting to that Apple manual. I felt as though I, the reader, was less important than the writer <em>to</em> the writer.</p>
<p>The reader is always more important than the technical writer.</p>
<p>Yes, it is hard&ndash;and deserves to be hard&ndash;to get the reader&rsquo;s attention. When no one is reading what you write, I can&rsquo;t get awfully worked up about a release note such as &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve updated the app to fix some crashes, make features load faster, and support iOS 17!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the editor in me still wants to write as well as I can. And remove unnecessary exclamation marks.</p>
