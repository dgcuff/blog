      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been posting. Why? Because I ran into a technical issue that prevented me from connecting to GitHub. Weekend after weekend, I tried to solve it.&#xA;I read post after post that claimed to have the fix. None of them helped. I have decent beginner&amp;rsquo;s technical skills, but I could not find a fix.&#xA;Eventually, I accepted that I was going to have to uninstall (part of) a commercial piece of software.</description>

      <description>While walking through my local park, I ran into a former co-worker from 20 years back. I had been creating documentation; he had been supporting customers. He mentioned to me, 20 years later, how helpful my documentation had been for him.&#xA;I do strive to write clearly for both users who need a quick refresher and those who are approaching the product for the first time, so I wasnâ€™t completely taken aback by his praise.</description>
