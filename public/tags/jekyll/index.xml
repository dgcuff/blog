      <description>As I mentioned in Why no blog updates for over a year, I ran into some problems with Jekyll, the framework I used to publish blog entries. I eventually fixed the problem. Then I tried to update Jekyll. Which caused different problems.&#xA;So I&amp;rsquo;m done with Jekyll. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to Hugo. While that is the name of Martin Scorscese&amp;rsquo;s only film for children, it&amp;rsquo;s also the name of another framework for building websites.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been posting. Why? Because I ran into a technical issue that prevented me from connecting to GitHub. (Donâ€™t know what that means? Essentially, I could write but not publish automatically.) Weekend after weekend, I tried to solve it.&#xA;I read post after post that claimed to have the fix. None of them helped. I have decent beginner&amp;rsquo;s technical skills, but I could not find a fix.&#xA;Eventually, I accepted that I was going to have to uninstall (part of) a commercial piece of software.</description>
