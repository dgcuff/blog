      <description>Development can be incredibly self-focussed. Development managers and developers share information with members of the development team, and can be positively stunned to learn that not everyone has access.&#xA;Nowhere is this more obvious than when development is complete.&#xA;There is a belief that the deadline is available to technical writers, and in my experience, it is not available more than 50% of the time. There is a stronger belief that the availability of a feature to product users is known to everyone once development is complete.</description>
