      <description>Assumptions engage our human emotions.&#xA;Some assumptions are embarrassing. CBC Radio &amp;ldquo;Morningside&amp;rdquo; host (the late) Peter Gzowski, long in a job that paid more than a living wage, once made the assumption that retirement tax breaks were available to all&amp;hellip; when they require a minimum income. Some assumptions are infuriating. In the &amp;ldquo;Doonebury&amp;rdquo; comic strip, cartoonist Garry Trudeau once did a masterful job of deflating privlege rather than ranting about it.</description>

      <description>Writing requires that you try to reach your reader. Technical writing doubly so. And that&amp;rsquo;s the part that isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. There are obstacles, and you have to do the work of overcoming all of them all of the time.&#xA;Here are five of my rules for technical writers.&#xA;You have to understand your topic.&#xA;In a lot of life, in conversations and in writing, you can have a vague idea of how something works.</description>
