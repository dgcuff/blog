      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a technical writer with a career of 20 years&amp;rsquo; experience in full-time documentation of software (and occasionally hardware).&#xA;When I was doing my undergraduate degree in English, I took a creative writing course. Each week, we had the assignment of writing in a different style, and it was always most enjoyable. The week that we had to demonstrate our skill in instructional writing, I took advantage of my natural aptitude for detail and wrote a procedure for making a photographic print using a film negative and an enlarger.</description>
