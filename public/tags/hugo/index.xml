      <description>As I mentioned in Why no blog updates for over a year, I ran into some problems with Jekyll, the framework I used to publish blog entries. I eventually fixed the problem. Then I tried to update Jekyll. Which caused different problems.&#xA;So I&amp;rsquo;m done with Jekyll. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to Hugo. While that is the name of Martin Scorscese&amp;rsquo;s only film for children, it&amp;rsquo;s also the name of another framework for building websites.</description>

      <description>While walking through my local park, I ran into a former co-worker from 20 years back. I had been creating documentation; he had been supporting customers. He mentioned to me, 20 years later, how helpful my documentation had been for him.&#xA;I do strive to write clearly for both users who need a quick refresher and those who are approaching the product for the first time, so I wasnâ€™t completely taken aback by his praise.</description>
