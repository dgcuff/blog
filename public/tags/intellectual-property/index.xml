      <description>Technical writers maintain samples of documents that they once created and add those sample documents to their professional portfolios. Even though I do not (repeat: not) have a portfolio for the sole purpose of employment, writing samples can be useful when seeking a new technical writing position.&#xA;Showing samples to prospective employers was always a grey area ethically. What we think of as samples are single copies of work to which we do not own the copyright.</description>
