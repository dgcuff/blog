      <description>The majority of developers and their managers have absolutely no idea what technical writers do. Most developers think of us as old-school secretaries (administrative assistants) who correct their typographical errors and handle their typing. If you are a developer who knows better, please educate your peers rather than sending me a note with the message “not all developers.”&#xA;Developers frequently work with time pressure. They have limited time to code and debug a feature.</description>

      <description>I spend most of my time at work thinking about the product users. Those are the people who will be reading what I wrote. That means I spend a lot of time considering what each person might not know, and might not know they don&amp;rsquo;t know. Part of the job of a technical writer is helping people learn. Which puts me in a very different head space than a lot of the people I work with.</description>

      <description>During the course of a career lasting over 20 years, would you care to guess how many times I have been given data from a software developer that later turned out not to be correct?&#xA;A maximum of three.&#xA;Once, another developer informed me that something I had written wasn&amp;rsquo;t true. I provided the developer with a copy of the e-mail in which a different developer had said it was true.</description>

      <description>Writing requires that you try to reach your reader. Technical writing doubly so. And that&amp;rsquo;s the part that isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. There are obstacles, and you have to do the work of overcoming all of them all of the time.&#xA;Here are five of my rules for technical writers.&#xA;You have to understand your topic.&#xA;In a lot of life, in conversations and in writing, you can have a vague idea of how something works.</description>
