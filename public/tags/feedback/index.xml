      <description>The most recent time I was considering and being considered for a new technical writing position, I got a surprise.

      <description>Over the years, I have been blessed by working with terrific people.&#xA;Testers. Managers. Developers. Software architects. Customer support people at various levels. Fellow technical writers. Executives. Subject matter experts.&#xA;Quite a lot of these people could write a lot better than they thought they could. When they wrote, they thought about the user.&#xA;Some of them couldn&amp;rsquo;t write well but they were great at talking about what they wanted to write&amp;hellip; if only I could get enough of their time to interview them.</description>
